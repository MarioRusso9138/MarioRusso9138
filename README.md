## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m a frontend developer specializing in building scalable single-page applications using Ember.js and Handlebars. This repository is a reflection of how I approach frontend architectureâ€”structured, maintainable, and built with long-term scalability in mind.

Emberâ€™s router is one of the key tools I rely on. I use it to define clear, URL-driven application states that map directly to the user experience. By taking advantage of nested routes and dynamic segments, I can keep the app logic predictable while creating fluid, stateful navigation across different views.

My UI is built with a component-first mindset. I break down the interface into reusable pieces using Ember components, each handling its own rendering logic, state, and styling. This makes the codebase easier to maintain and scale, especially as projects grow in complexity. I structure components by feature rather than type, which helps keep things organized and easy to navigate.

For data management, I work with Ember Data to handle models, relationships, and API integration. I prefer declarative data loading patterns, using Emberâ€™s conventions for adapters and serializers to reduce boilerplate and keep the logic clean. In more complex apps, I use services and tracked properties to manage shared or reactive state across components.

Emberâ€™s conventions and opinionated structure let me focus more on solving real problems and less on setting up tooling from scratch. This repo is a starting point for how I build SPAsâ€”focused on maintainability, performance, and clear separation of concerns.

If you're working with Ember or considering it for a project, I hope this gives you a practical look at how I put its ecosystem to use.
